# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added firebase/firestore to wallet app using hooks.

**Thoughts:** React is still difficult for me, but now I start to understand how I can manage the app's state using hooks. Vim is awesome, I'm using SpaceVim.

### Day 2: February 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Now budget value (month budget) is getting from db (firestore).

**Thoughts:** Difficult part: connection hooks with request to firestore. I think I should move firestore mutation component to another global place.
