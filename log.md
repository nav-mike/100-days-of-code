# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added firebase/firestore to wallet app using hooks.

**Thoughts:** React is still difficult for me, but now I start to understand how I can manage the app's state using hooks. Vim is awesome, I'm using SpaceVim.

### Day 2: February 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Now budget value (month budget) is getting from db (firestore).

**Thoughts:** Difficult part: connection hooks with request to firestore. I think I should move firestore mutation component to another global place.

### Day 3: February 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I learnt react hooks whole day. I've added action's constant and reducer function.

**Thoughts:** Vim is awesome. React hooks are still difficult for me, but I understand it better. I think I will finish with hooks next week.

### Day 4: February 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I removed react-firestore. I'm trying to use pure firestore lib for the app.

**Thoughts:** I think, I should develop a state for the app using fure firestore lib, because my state includes budget val and outcomes val from firestore db and I should manage it.
