# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added firebase/firestore to wallet app using hooks.

**Thoughts:** React is still difficult for me, but now I start to understand how I can manage the app's state using hooks. Vim is awesome, I'm using SpaceVim.

**Link to work:** [Wallet](https://github.com/nav-mike/wallet)
